# Introduction

## Introduction
This lesson summarizes the topics we'll be covering in section 05 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what is covered in this section
* Understand and explain why the section will help you to become a data scientist

## All About SQL

One of the biggest challenges for a data scientist is getting access to the data you need. In previous sections we showed you how to import data from csv and xls files. In this section, we're going to do a deep dive into the Structured Query Language (SQL - often pronounced as either "S - Q - L" or "sequel"). In many companies, the majority of their data is stored in SQL databases, so it's incredibly important for a professional data scientist to be comfortable with retriving information using SQL.

### Database Basics

In the next couple of lessons, we'll make sure you can connect to a SQL database from Jupyter notebook and that you learn some of the basic ideas underlying SQL. We then run you through the various data types commonly found in SQL databases and which ones you should use for what sorts of data.

### SELECT

We then dig into the command you're going to use most often - the `SELECT` statement which is used to retrive data from a database.

### Filtering and Ordering

We then dig into the `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` commands that allow you to retrive a subset of the data in a table and control the order in which it's retured.

### Relationships in SQL

After that we dig into one of the most powerful features of SQL - it's ability to join related tables, running you through the various types of join's you're likely to encounter when trying to pull the information you need from an organizational database.

### Grouping in SQL

We then spend a little bit of time introducing and giving you practice working with aggregate and grouped data using `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.


### SQL in Pandas

Finally we'll look at how you can use SQL statements right within a Pandas DataFrame, making it not just a tool to retrive 
After a brief introduction to the most popular data science libraries in Python, section 03 takes you deeper into imporing and accessing data using the two key Pandas data structures - Series Aand DataFrames.

## Summary Stats

We then look at some of the methods built right into Pandas for generating descriptive statistics when doing your initial exploratory data analysis.

## Customizing Visualizations

We then look at how you can start to customize your visualizations in Matplotlin, and look at the data visualization capabilities exposed directly within Pandas for quick and efficient plotting.

## Welcome to Kaggle

We then introduce the very popular Boston Housing data set, and we use that as an excuse to get you set up on Kaggle - an important destination for any practicing data scientist. We then give you a project using the Boston Housing data to let you practice your statistical and visualization skills.

## Summary

In this section, we're leveraging the programming and statistical concepts from earlier sections to provide you with additional practice working with various data sets.
